## PathPlan

PathPlan(Octave) is a library of one-dimmentional kinematic functions aimed to solve path planning decisions for point-to-point movements. The paths are designed with constant acceleration segments. For specific inputs, each function can provide a full path profile.

The list of functions include:

- `GetAcc`
- `GetTimeDur`
- `GetDist`
- `GetVel`
- `GetTimeDiff`
- `GetAccInTimeDiff`
- `GetAccInTimeDiffWithRise`
- `GetPoint`
- `SecondOrderRoots`
