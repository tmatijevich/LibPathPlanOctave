# Introduction

## PathPlan

PathPlan(Octave) is a library of one-dimensional kinematic functions aimed to solve path planning decisions for point-to-point movements. The paths are designed with constant acceleration segments. For specific inputs, each function can provide a full path profile.

### List of Functions

- `PathAcc`
- `PathTime`
- `PathDist`
- `PathVel`
- `PathTimeDiff`
- `PathAccInTimeDiff`
- `PathAccInTimeDiffWithRise`
- `PathRoots`
- `PathPoint`
